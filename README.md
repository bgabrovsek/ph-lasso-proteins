# ph-lasso-proteins
A persistent homology approach to detecting lasso proteins

This library uses persistent homology to efficiently detect lasso proteins, together with the intersection points between the protein tail and the loop formed by disulfide bridges.
It compares the detected crossings with existing annotations from LassoProt and AlphaLasso.
The library provides tools for visualizing lasso proteins and their corresponding persistence diagrams, and is able to distinguish between supercoiled and non-supercoiled lasso types.
